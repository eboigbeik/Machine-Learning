## Project Objective:
The first  phase of this project involved  scraping unstructured customer reviews data from an online business listing website into a structured csv format.
This second phase protrays the use of Natural Laguage TooKit(nltk) for cleaning and pre-pocessing the data and doing feature engineering work to prepare it for building a machine learning model. I also looked into  the selection of the best algorithm for the model based on prediction accuracy.

## Summary of Results:
We use Naive Bayes, Benouli Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classifier(SVC),Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), RandomForest and logistic regression Classifiers to build our model. Of all the algorithms used,logistic regression performed better with over 91% accuracy.
